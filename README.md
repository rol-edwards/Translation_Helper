React app to help language learners analyse sentences.

The concept is to mimic how a language-learner might annotate a translation exercise by hand, if they are trying to learn to analyse the general sense of a sentence without laboriously looking up every new word.

The user pastes text they wish to translate. They can then add their translation to each word as they go, mark what part of speech they think a word is, or add some notes about the word. Clicking on the word brings up all the information on it. They can also add the word to a list of new vocab to learn. 

The app keeps count of how many instances of a given word are clicked on; the idea would be to automatically generate a short vocab list of the most frequently occurring new words, so that the user prioritises learning vocab most relevant to the kind of documents they want to translate. 

The direction of the text can be flipped, for Ararbic, for example.
